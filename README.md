# SpaceColumbus

Travel in space, drop-in on an (inhabited) planet, destroy all local (wild-)life, extract some (all) resources and settle inâ€¦ Then move on to the next planet and do that again!

# Repo Contents:

This repo contains all code and most of the art assets for the game Space Columbus.

I am currently working on this as a personal project; development is mainly fueled by my own creative desires and ideas. 
As I have other responsibilities to attend to, I only work here on and off, but I do plan to complete this work one day.
As it stands, I expect a playable version of the game to release in late 2021, targeting a Steam release in 2022.
